## Bootstrap tools

This website utilises CSS and JavaScript from the [Bootstrap framework](https://getbootstrap.com/).

In particular, it makes use of the [Tooltip component](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/tooltips/), which allows for little popovers to display additional information when the mouse is moved over specified HTML elements.

Easiest would be to simply use an official Bootstrap CDN to include the relevant CSS and JavaScript files. However, this forces a reboot of all underlying styles already implemented by the [ANU style system](https://webpublishing.anu.edu.au/web-style-guide). So, instead, we only include styles relevant to the Tooltip component.
