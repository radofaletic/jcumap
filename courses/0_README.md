## XML files for individual courses

This folder contains XML files, from the *JCUMap* software, that describe mappings for ANU courses.

For each course, there are two files, prefixed by the course code as depicted on the P&C website.

1. The first file contains the *JCUMap* mapping, as inputed to the software (e.g. `ENGN1211.xml`)
2. The second file contains the *JCUMap* mapping result, as is produced by the software (e.g. `ENGN1211MappingResult.xml`)

It is important that in the *JCUMap* software, you enter the actual course code, in uppercase. Other than this caveat, no additional attention is necessary.
